Recall:

Product Rule: $$\mathbb{P}(A \cap B) = \mathbb{P}(B)\mathbb{P}(A \given B)$$

Bayes' Formula: $$\mathbb{P}(A \given B) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(B \given A)\cdot \mathbb{P}(A)}{\mathbb{P}(B)}$$

\subsubsection{The Law of Total Probability}

$S = B_1 \cup B_2 \cup B_3 \cup B_4$ with $B_i \cap B_j = \varnothing$. Want to calculate $\mathbb{P}(E)$.

$$E = (E\cap B_1) \cup (E \cap B_2) \cup (E \cap B_3) \cup (E \cap B_4)$$

Therefore,

\begin{align}
\mathbb{P}(E) &= \mathbb{P}((E\cap B_1) \cup (E \cap B_2) \cup (E \cap B_3) \cup (E \cap B_4)) \\
              &= \mathbb{P}(B_1)\mathbb{P}(E\given B_1) + \cdots + \mathbb{P}(B_4)\mathbb{P}(E \given B_4)
\end{align}

\begin{exmp}
A, B, and C produce ``good'' (G) objects with probability (w.p.) 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9 respectively.

Out of total production of company, A does 40\%, B does 45\%, and C does 15\%.

Chosing a random object, what is the probability that the object is good? ($\mathbb{P}(G)$)
$$S = A \cup B \cup C$$
\begin{align}
\mathbb{P}(G) &= \mathbb{P}(A)\mathbb{P}(G \given A) + \mathbb{P}(B) \mathbb{P}(G \given A) + \mathbb{P}(C) \mathbb{P}(G \given C)
              &= 0.4 \cdot 0.7 + 0.45 \cdot 0.8 + 0.15 \cdot 0.9 = 0.775
\end{align}

Now what is the probability that a faulty object (F) was produced by A?
\begin{align}
\mathbb{P}(A \given F) &= \frac{\mathbb{P}(F \given F)}{\mathbb{P}(F)}
                       &= \frac{\mathbb{P}(A)\mathbb{P}(F\given A)}{1 - \mathbb{P}(G)}
                       &= \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.3}{1 - 0.775}
\end{align}

\end{exmp}

You can see that it is often helpful to rewrite Bayes' using the Law of Total Probability:

\begin{align}
\mathbb{P}(B_1 \given E) &= \frac{\mathbb{P}(E \given B_i)\mathbb{P}(B_i)}{\mathbb{P}(E)} \\
                         &= \frac{\mathbb{P}(E \given B_i)\mathbb{P}(B_i)}{\mathbb{P}(B_1)\mathbb{P}(E\given B_1 + \cdots + \mathbb{P}(B_n)\mathbb{P}(E \given B_n))}
\end{align}

\subsection{Examples}

\begin{exmp}
Simpson's Paradox

A, B drugs

A taken by 1100, healed 170 (H)
B taken by 200, 60 H

\begin{align}
\mathbb{P}(H\given A) &= \frac{170}{1100} \approx 0.15 \\
\mathbb{P}(H\given B) &= \frac{60}{200} = 0.3
\end{align}

This makes it seem like B is better, but:

Out of the 1100 that took A, 1000 were women, out of which 110 where healed, and out of the 100 men, 60 were healed.

Out of the 200 that took B, 100 were women, out of which 10 where healed, and out of the 100 men, 50 were healed.

$$\mathbb{P}(H \given (A\cap M)) = 0.6$$

$$\mathbb{P}(H \given (B \cap M)) = 0.5$$

So A was better for men.

$$\mathbb{P}(H \given (B\cap W)) = 0.11$$

$$\mathbb{P}(H \given (B \cap W)) = 0.1$$

So A was also better for women.

\begin{exmp}
    First game, each player wins with probability $1/2$. From then on, you have $2/3$ chance if you won the previous game, and $1/3$ if you lost.

    Rules: If you win first two games, you win. Otherwise, decider round.

    $$\mathbb{P}(\textrm{winning}) = \mathbb{P}(WW) + \mathbb{P}(WLW) + \mathbb{P}(LWW) = 1/2$$

    $$\mathbb{P}(\textrm{winning}\given\textrm{win first game}) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(\textrm{Win and win first})}{\mathbb{P}(\textrm{1st game})} = \frac{1/2*2/3 + 1/2 * 1/3 * 1/3}{1/2} = 7/9$$

\end{exmp}
